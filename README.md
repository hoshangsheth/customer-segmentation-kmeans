## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on spending behavior and income data. The goal is to uncover distinct customer profiles that businesses can use for **targeted marketing, personalization, and product positioning**.

Key steps included:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm  
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization  
- Strategic insights from cluster patterns

## 🧾 Dataset

The dataset includes customer demographic and transactional features:
- `Customer ID`
- `Gender`
- `Annual Income`
- `Spending Score`
- `Purchase Behavior`
