# Project: Customer Segmentation Model

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to segment customers into two primary groups:
1. **Luxury Shoppers**
2. **Budget-Conscious Buyers**

By analyzing spending patterns, the model delivers personalized marketing recommendations to optimize business strategies and customer engagement.

## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation** with K-Means clustering algorithm
- **Dimensionality Reduction** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better visualization
- **Interactive Dashboard** developed with Streamlit for ease of use
- **Dynamic Data Visualization** powered by Plotly
- **User-friendly Interface** featuring an intuitive Option Menu for seamless navigation

## Requirements
Make sure to install all required Python libraries by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <your-project-folder>

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

## Deployment
To deploy on **Streamlit Cloud**:
1. Push your project to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub to Streamlit Cloud
3. Deploy with `requirements.txt` included

## How It Works
1. Users input customer data through the app interface.
2. The model processes the data and classifies customers into **Luxury Shoppers** or **Budget-Conscious Buyers**.
3. Personalized marketing insights and recommendations are displayed on the dashboard.
4. Users can gain insights from the visualizations to explore trends and patterns.
